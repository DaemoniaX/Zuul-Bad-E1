# Zuul-Bad-E1
Java game project developed during my 1st year, unfinished, but working at least.

The game "Lost or LOST?" is a turn-based game developed and framed by the instructions of the teacher.

I'm saying "framed" because all of the functions we had to put in the game were dictated by the teacher and the **way of development** was also dictated.
So I'm the one that coded and fine-tuned the game....but not exactly since I was not able to code and put whatever I wanted to. 
There are some things that make absolutely no sense, poorly developed, but...that was due to the instructions.
This way of developing but not developing frustrated me enormously considering the abominations I had to put in the code.
This project was never meant to be finished in the 1st place, but it is playable.

**How to start the game :** 

-install java SDE
-install blueJ
-create a new game using the Game class constructor


Originally, you couldn't start the game because it was asked by the teacher to put the class to start the game into private and not public...
Also, java -jar ZuulBad_E1.jar doesn't work because we never learned manifest.
